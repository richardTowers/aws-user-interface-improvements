aws-user-interface-improvements
===============================

A browser extenstion which makes some tweaks to the AWS console user interface
to make it a bit more usable.

For example, if you sign in with a federated login, it will try to show you the
important bits (like which role and account you're in) instead of the garbage AWS
shows by default.
